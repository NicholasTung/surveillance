body = "Being the top doctor in the city, Murphy was assigned as head doctor for an incident where a high profile government official was found to have head trauma. While initially, it seemed like the government official was going to survive, things went awry. After several days of operation, reports from other doctors made it appear that the government official was recovering well. However, suspiciously after a period of time where the doctor was alone with the patient, the officialâ€™s condition suddenly worsened and he eventually died. While this may be a case of a very poor coincidence, other doctors say the new symptoms could not have occurred without some outside influence. Since it appears no one else had contact with the official in the right period of time, Murphy has been listed as a high-profile suspect. A clear motive has not yet been determined; however, Murphy has previously been heard voicing his frustration with certain government actions. From being one of the most well-respected doctors to a suspected murderer, Murphy has fled the city. "
